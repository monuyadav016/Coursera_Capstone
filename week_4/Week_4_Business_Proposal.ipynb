    "Mumbai is the financial capital of India and is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. It lies on the west coast of India and attracts heavy tourism from all over the globe every year. Personally, I have been brought up in Mumbai and have loved the city from the bottom of my heart. It is one of the major hubs of the world and is extremely diverse with people from various ethnicities residing here. The multi-cultural nature of the city of Mumbai has brought along with it numerous cuisines from all over the world. The people of India generally love food and I personally love to try different cuisines and experience different flavors. Thus, the aim of this project is to study the neighborhoods in Mumbai to determine possible locations for opening a restaurant. This project can be useful for business owners and entrepreneurs who are looking to invest in a restaurant in Mumbai. The main objective of this project is to carefully analyze appropriate data and find recommendations for the stakeholders."
